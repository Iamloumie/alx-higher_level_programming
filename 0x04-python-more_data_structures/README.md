# Python Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various programming concepts and exercises. Each file is designed to showcase different aspects of Python programming, from basic operations to more advanced data structure manipulations.

## File Descriptions

### Main Exercise Files

- `0-square_matrix_simple.py`: Computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
- `1-search_replace.py`: Replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
- `2-uniq_add.py`: Adds all unique integers in a list.
- `3-common_elements.py`: Returns a set of common elements in two sets.
- `4-only_diff_elements.py`: Returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
- `5-number_keys.py`: Returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
- `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`: Prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
- `7-update_dictionary.py`: Replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
- `8-simple_delete.py`: Deletes a key in a dictionary.
- `9-multiply_by_2.py`: Returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
- `10-best_score.py`: Returns a key with the biggest integer value.
- `11-multiply_list_map.py`: Returns a list with all values multiplied by a number using map.
- `12-roman_to_int.py`: Converts a Roman numeral to an integer.

### Advanced Exercises

- `100-weight_average.py`: Returns the weighted average of all integers tuple.
- `101-square_matrix_map.py`: Computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map.
- `102-complex_delete.py`: Deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.

### Test Files

Files prefixed with numbers and suffixed with `-main.py` (e.g., `0-main.py`, `1-main.py`, etc.) are test files for the corresponding exercise files.

## Usage

To run any of the exercises, use Python 3. For example:

```
python3 0-main.py
```

This will execute the main file, which typically imports and tests the corresponding exercise file.

## Note

These exercises are designed to help you practice and improve your Python programming skills. They cover a range of topics including:

- List and set operations
- Dictionary manipulations
- Basic algorithms
- Functional programming concepts (map, lambda)
- Math operations

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon these exercises to further your understanding of Python programming.
