# Python Exceptions Project

This project contains various Python scripts demonstrating exception handling and safe operations.

## Files

### Python Scripts

- `0-main.py`: Main file for testing `0-safe_print_list.py`
- `0-safe_print_list.py`: Safely prints a list of integers
- `1-safe_print_integer.py`: Safely prints an integer
- `2-main.py`: Main file for testing `2-safe_print_list_integers.py`
- `2-safe_print_list_integers.py`: Safely prints the first x elements of a list and only integers
- `3-main.py`: Main file for testing `3-safe_print_division.py`
- `3-safe_print_division.py`: Safely divides two integers and prints the result
- `4-list_division.py`: Divides element by element two lists
- `5-raise_exception.py`: Raises a type exception
- `6-raise_exception_msg.py`: Raises a name exception with a message
- `100-main.py`: Main file for testing `100-safe_print_integer_err.py`
- `100-safe_print_integer_err.py`: Safely prints an integer and handles errors
- `101-safe_function.py`: Executes a function safely and handles errors
- `102-magic_calculation.py`: Python function that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode

### C File

- `103-python.c`: C functions that print some basic info about Python lists, bytes, and float objects

## Usage

To run any of the Python scripts, use the following command:

```
python3 <script_name>.py
```

For example:

```
python3 0-main.py
```

The C file `103-python.c` is likely meant to be compiled as a Python extension module.
Refer to the project instructions for specific compilation and usage details.

## Note

This project focuses on exception handling in Python.
Each script demonstrates different aspects of working with exceptions, safe operations, and error handling.
Make sure to review the code and comments in each file for specific functionality and usage instructions.
