# Rectangle Project

This project contains a series of Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation and progression of a Rectangle class. It also includes a solution to the N-Queens problem.

## Files

### Rectangle Class Implementation

0. `0-rectangle.py`: Initial empty class definition for Rectangle.
1. `1-rectangle.py`: Rectangle class with width and height attributes.
2. `2-rectangle.py`: Added area and perimeter methods to Rectangle class.
3. `3-rectangle.py`: Implemented string representation of Rectangle.
4. `4-rectangle.py`: Added repr() method for Rectangle.
5. `5-rectangle.py`: Implemented deletion message for Rectangle instances.
6. `6-rectangle.py`: Added class attribute to count number of instances.
7. `7-rectangle.py`: Changed string representation symbol.
8. `8-rectangle.py`: Added static method to compare rectangle areas.
9. `9-rectangle.py`: Added class method to create a square.

### Main Files

- `0-main.py`: Test file for `0-rectangle.py`.

### Additional Problems

- `101-nqueens.py`: Solution to the N-Queens problem.

## Usage

To test each implementation of the Rectangle class, run the corresponding main file. For example:

```
python3 0-main.py
```

To solve the N-Queens problem, run:

```
python3 101-nqueens.py N
```

Where N is the size of the chessboard and the number of queens to place.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
