# Python Square Project

This project contains various Python files related to implementing and testing a Square class, as well as a singly linked list implementation and a magic class.

## Files

### Main Files

These files contain test cases and examples for using the Square class:

- `0-main.py`
- `1-main.py`
- `2-main.py`
- `3-main.py`
- `4-main.py`
- `5-main.py`
- `6-main.py`

### Square Class Implementations

These files contain different versions of the Square class, each building upon the previous one:

- `0-square.py`
- `1-square.py`
- `2-square.py`
- `3-square.py`
- `4-square.py`
- `5-square.py`
- `6-square.py`
- `101-square.py`
- `102-square.py`

### Additional Classes

- `100-singly_linked_list.py`: Implementation of a singly linked list
- `103-magic_class.py`: Implementation of a MagicClass

## Usage

To run the tests for each Square class implementation, use the corresponding main file. For example:

```
python3 0-main.py
python3 1-main.py
# ... and so on
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured to progressively build up the Square class with more features and functionality.
Each numbered version of the Square class (0-square.py, 1-square.py, etc.) likely adds new methods or attributes to the class.

## Additional Notes

- The `100-singly_linked_list.py` file implements a singly linked list, which is a fundamental data structure in computer science.
- The `103-magic_class.py` file likely contains a class with special methods (magic methods) in Python.

For more detailed information about each file and its contents, please refer to the individual files and their docstrings.
